# Automated-Feature-and-Defect-Analysis-for-Semiconducting-Materials

**Overview**
This project focuses on automating the analysis of defects in semiconductor materials, specifically Line Edge Roughness (LER) and Line Width Roughness (LWR). By leveraging SPA (Signal Processing Algorithms) and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) techniques, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy and efficiency.

**Objectives**
Identify and analyze LER and LWR defects in semiconductor structures.
Implement SPA techniques for precise defect pattern analysis.
Utilize SEM imaging for high-resolution defect identification.
Develop an automated system to streamline defect detection and analysis.

**Technologies Used**
Signal Processing Algorithms (SPA)
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Data Processing & Visualization Tools
Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)

**Current Progress**
Frontend Development: Basic website design is completed.
Research on SPA and SEM techniques is in progress.
Dataset collection for defect analysis is ongoing.

**My Contribution**
I have primarily worked on the frontend development of the project, designing the interface that will eventually integrate the defect analysis tools.

**Next Steps**
Improve the frontend interface for data visualization.
Implement backend integration for analysis and reporting.
Develop the automated defect detection system.
