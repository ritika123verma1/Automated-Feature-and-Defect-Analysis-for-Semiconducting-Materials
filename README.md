# Automated-Feature-and-Defect-Analysis-for-Semiconducting-Materials

**Overview**
The goal of this project is to automate the analysis and detection of semiconductor material defects, with a particular emphasis on Line Edge Roughness (LER) and Line Width Roughness (LWR). By integrating Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imagery with Signal Processing Algorithms (SPA), we created a reliable system that improves the precision, speed, and effectiveness of defect detection in semiconductor structures at the nanoscale.

**Objectives**

- Find and examine LER and LWR flaws in semiconductor characteristics.
- Utilize signal processing methods to identify and assess defect patterns.
- For high-resolution surface analysis, use SEM imagery.
- Create an automated system to make defect reporting and identification more efficient.

**Technologies Used**

- Signal Processing Algorithms (SPA)
- Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
- Data Processing & Visualization Tools
- Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- Backend & Data Handling (future scalability)

**Project Outcomes**

- Successful implementation of an automated defect analysis pipeline
- Integrated high-resolution SEM image processing
- Frontend user interface finished with support for real-time data visualization
- A working prototype that shows accurate LER/LWR detection

**My Contribution**

My main contribution was to the frontend development, which produced an intuitive and responsive interface for showcasing defect data and SEM photos.  Additionally, I collaborated with the research and data teams to guarantee the smooth integration of analytical tools and visual outputs.

**Key Features**

- Upload and view SEM images through the web interface
- Analyze edge/width roughness using automated SPA logic
- Visual flags for defect locations and severity
- Responsive UI for research and industrial usability

**Concluding Implementation Highlights**

- Visual feedback in real time on material flaws
- For upcoming backend updates, the design is integration-ready.
- React-based frontend architecture that is scalable and modular

**The scope of the future**

- Use deep learning to classify defects in a more complex way.
- Allow analytical reports to be exported in CSV and PDF formats.
- Combine a database and backend to enable batch analysis.
- Go beyond LER/LWR and incorporate additional semiconductor feature kinds.
